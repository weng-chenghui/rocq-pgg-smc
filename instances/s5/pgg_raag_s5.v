(* Nat-level generator function for vm_compute:
   gen i swaps i and i+1 (adjacent transposition) *)
Definition s5_gens_nat (i x : nat) : nat :=
  match i with
  | 0 => match x with 0 => 1 | 1 => 0 | _ => x end
  | 1 => match x with 1 => 2 | 2 => 1 | _ => x end
  | 2 => match x with 2 => 3 | 3 => 2 | _ => x end
  | _ => match x with 3 => 4 | 4 => 3 | _ => x end
  end.

(** s5_gens_agree — the nat-level swap function [s5_gens_nat] agrees with
    the perm-level path-RAAG generator [tnth (path_gen_tuple 3)] at every
    generator index and seat. Equating the two is what lets word-evaluation
    facts below ([s5_weval_inj1], the trace counts) be settled by
    [vm_compute] on the decidable nat description instead of computing with
    permutations directly. *)
Lemma s5_gens_agree (i : 'I_4) (x : 'I_5) :
  s5_gens_nat (val i) (val x) = val (tnth (path_gen_tuple 3) i x).
Proof.
by case: i => [[|[|[|[|?]]]] Hi];
  case: x => [[|[|[|[|[|?]]]]] Hx];
  rewrite ?gen_tuple_ofE /path_gen /path_lo /path_hi ?permE.
Qed.

(** s5_weval_inj1 — word evaluation is injective at length 1 for the S_5
    path-RAAG generators: two single-generator words that evaluate to the
    same permutation are the same generator. This is the shortest length at
    which injectivity can hold at all, since length 2 already collapses
    words like [i,i] to the identity because every generator is an
    involution (noted below). *)
Lemma s5_weval_inj1 : @weval_inj (@Gen_PGGTypes 3 3 (path_gen_tuple 3)) 1.
Proof. apply: (weval_inj_of_natB s5_gens_agree). by vm_compute. Qed.

(* Note: word-eval injectivity at L=2 fails because adjacent transpositions
   are involutions (s_i^2 = 1 for all i), so words [i,i] all evaluate to
   the identity. *)

(* vm_compute trace count demonstrations *)
(* N=5, Tg=4, comm = path (|i-j| >= 2) *)

(** s5_nt_L1 — [n_traces_natB] evaluated at the S_5 path-RAAG independence
    relation counts 4 length-1 commutation classes, one per generator: at
    length 1 no commutation identifies distinct words, so the trace count is
    just the generator count. *)
Lemma s5_nt_L1 : n_traces_natB 4 1 path_comm_nat = 4.
Proof. by vm_compute. Qed.

(** s5_nt_L2 — [n_traces_natB] evaluated at the S_5 path-RAAG independence
    relation counts 13 distinct commutation classes of length-2 words: a
    decidable, [vm_compute]-checked instance of the general trace-counting
    machinery at this generator set. *)
Lemma s5_nt_L2 : n_traces_natB 4 2 path_comm_nat = 13.
Proof. by vm_compute. Qed.

(** s5_nt_L3 — the same count at length 3 is 40 distinct commutation
    classes. *)
Lemma s5_nt_L3 : n_traces_natB 4 3 path_comm_nat = 40.
Proof. by vm_compute. Qed.
