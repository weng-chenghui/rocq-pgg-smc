(** s5_M — the S_5 adjacent-transposition monodromy template (N = 5).
    @intent: a notation for the Gen_PGGTypes form s5_PI and s5_plug carry, so
    the run definitions share their type. s5_M is a section-local Let in the
    rigidity instance, hence not exported; spelled out here. *)
Local Notation s5_M := (@Gen_PGGTypes 3 3 (path_gen_tuple 3)).

(** s5_scheme — the S_5 sum-mod sharing scheme on 'I_5, convertible to
    rp_scheme s5_plug.
    @intent: the threshold scheme the dealer shares and the verifier
    reconstructs; the five-party sum-mod scheme. Named directly (rather than
    rp_scheme s5_plug) so the operational lemmas stay closed under the global
    context: s5_plug bundles the genus gap field, whose proof uses the
    justified Bring-curve facts, which are never exercised by the run. *)
Definition s5_scheme : ThresholdScheme 'I_5 'I_5 := @sum_mod_scheme 3 4.

(** s5_scheme_plug — s5_scheme is the scheme dealt by the s5 plug.
    @composes: s5_endpoints. *)
Lemma s5_scheme_plug : rp_scheme s5_plug = s5_scheme.
Proof. by []. Qed.

(** s5_players — the five-player list for the S_5 dealing phase.
    @intent: the explicit five-element list of 'I_5 player ordinals; a concrete
    list (rather than enum 'I_5) lets the dealer's fold_senv reduce under
    vm_compute. Used-by: s5_dealer_run, s5_saprocs. *)

(** s5_dealer_run — the S_5 dealer via the generic input-encoding dealer
    (identity cut, empty input prologue, position-model content reading the
    shares ts_encode s5_scheme s of the dealt secret s).
    @intent: deals the encoded shares of the secret position s; the empty
    prologue [::] makes this a pure position-model dealer. Used-by:
    s5_saprocs. *)

    [:: w0] [::] s5_players 0.

(** s5_saprocs — dealer ++ verifier ++ five players, ordered by process id
    (0..6). @intent: the seven session-typed processes of one S_5 run.
    Used-by: s5_procs. *)

Definition s5_procs (s : 'I_5) (w0 : pgg_gT s5_M) := erase_aprocs (s5_saprocs s w0).

(** s5_run_terminates — every process reaches Finish (7 procs), for any cut w0. *)
Lemma s5_run_terminates (s : 'I_5) (w0 : pgg_gT s5_M) :
  (run_interp 150 (s5_procs s w0)).1 = nseq 7 Finish.
Proof. by vm_compute. Qed.

(** s5_verifier_endpoints — the verifier's executed endpoints are the dealt
    content readout at the deck cut and starts, one per player.

Proof. by rewrite s5_endpoints size_map size_enum_ord. Qed.

(** s5_run_recovers — reconstructing the verifier's executed endpoints returns
    the dealt secret position s, for ANY cut w0 in the group.
    @main correctness: the running S_5 protocol recovers the dealt secret
    position s : 'I_5 from the verifier's cut-permuted endpoints, via the
    scheme's reconstruction perm-invariance (rp_recon_invariant) at w0. *)
