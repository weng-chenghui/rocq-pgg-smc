(** s5x5_scheme — the S_5 x S_5 product sum-mod sharing scheme on 'I_10,
    convertible to rp_scheme s5x5_plug.
    @intent: the threshold scheme the dealer shares and the verifier
    reconstructs; the two-pile product of the five-party sum-mod scheme. Named
    directly (rather than rp_scheme s5x5_plug) so the operational lemmas stay
    closed under the global context: s5x5_plug bundles the genus gap field
    s5x5_cs_gap, whose proof uses the justified group-order fact
    s5x5_group_order_eq, which is never exercised by the run. *)
