   an observed execution over that plug, Sampled adds a sample adapter over
   that execution together with its distribution-to-observer bridge, and
   AnalysisBridged adds a theorem about that distribution and that observer. *)

(* Relation an analysis path establishes between its executed model and an
   idealized one. IdealFinite is a public model-transfer theorem, and the
   row's prose names the ideal and the carrier of the transfer: the
   constructor covers both a cut-carrier transfer whose base premise is
   discharged and an observer-level transfer to a named ideal at the
   endpoint carrier. NegativeTransfer is a theorem transporting an
   obstruction to the path's observer. StaticExecutedOnly and
   NoModelComparison carry no such theorem, and the manifest row of such a
   path names the absent premise instead. *)

(** AnalysisModelFamily — a family of sample adapters over one observed
    execution.
    Kind: interface.
    A constructor supplies the index type amf_index R of the family at each
    real field and the sample map amf_sample sending an index to a sample
    adapter over the execution projected from the observed execution. A
    fixed model is a family with unit index; a parameterized model uses its
    real index type. *)

                   amf_index R
                   -> @SampleAdapter R _ (OE.oe_execution observed) ;

(* Under Set Implicit Arguments every argument of the amf_sample projection
   becomes implicit, including the family itself; the directive restores the
   call form amf_sample f R x, with only the observed execution inferred. *)

(** AnalysisModelSlot — the completion-indexed model slot of a manifest row.
    @intent: at Sampled and AnalysisBridged the slot is a mandatory
    AnalysisModelFamily over the row's observed execution, so a row at those
    levels cannot be constructed without a typed model witness; at the three
    lower levels the slot is an optional family. *)
